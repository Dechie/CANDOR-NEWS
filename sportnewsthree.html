    <h2> Brazillian football legend dies aged 82! </h2>
    Bobby Charlton said that football might have been "invented for him".

Certainly, most commentators regard him as the finest exponent of the beautiful game.

Pele's skill and electrifying speed were coupled with a deadly accuracy in front of goal.

A national hero in his native Brazil, he became a global sporting icon.

And, off the field, he campaigned tirelessly to improve conditions for the most deprived people in society.
Brazilian football legend Pele, arguably the greatest player ever, has died at the age of 82.

He is credited with scoring a world record 1,281 goals in 1,363 appearances during a 21-year career, including 77 goals in 92 matches for his country.

The only player to win the World Cup three times, lifting the trophy in 1958, 1962 and 1970, Pele was named Fifa's Player of the Century in 2000.

He had been suffering with kidney and prostate problems in recent years.

Pele had surgery to remove a tumour from his colon in September 2021 at the Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo, after the tumour was detected in routine tests. He was readmitted to hospital in late November 2022.

His daughter Kely Nascimento has kept fans updated on her father's condition with regular social media updates from hospital.

On Thursday she posted a picture of what appeared to be Pele's family's hands on his body in hospital and wrote: "Everything we are is thanks to you. We love you infinitely. Rest in peace.
