   <h2> "Scaloni will be fated,Messi will be sainted" </h2>
    There is something so special about football commentary.

Sure, all sports have their commentators, and it does take a particular skill to narrate the plotlines and scenes of any game or match. But any fan of the beautiful game can recognize that the commentary in football can change an entire memory of a goal, a save, or a World Cup win, in such a way that is incomparable to any other sport.

Peter Drury, one of the most well-known football commentators, has done precisely this in last night’s dramatic World Cup final.

Here are six quotes from last night’s game that encapsulated and immortalized one of the greatest matches of all time, as well as the greatest player of all time.

“Lionel Messi stares up at his final peak, Kylian Mbappe prowls in the foothills of greatness.”
In Drury’s opening line, he is referencing Messi’s “final peak” — his last journey to a World Cup trophy.

Meanwhile, Mbappe is in the “foothills of greatness” — about to climb the same mountain as the man over 11 years his senior, yet unlike Messi, his career is still just beginning.



    Before the match had even started, Peter Drury was already building the story in the most poetic way possible. Here, he cites the players of the match, as though he knew that we were about to witness one of the greatest football matches of all time, the storyline defined by these two extraordinary characters.

“A breath. A heartbeat. And Messi!”
There is nothing quite like being given a penalty, especially on the stage of the World Cup final.

As for Messi’s case last night, when he lined up to take the penalty to take the lead, he had the weight of a nation on his shoulders. Before Messi ran up to the ball, “A breath. A heartbeat.” — Peter Drury’s words capture the weight and tension of that feeling in the span of four words.

And once he scores, he yells his name, “Messi!” before pausing to let anyone watching from home hear the screams of thousands of Argentinian fans in Lusail Stadium.
n 2014, he came knocking on the door. But a heartbreaking loss to Germany in that year’s final meant that he had to wait not four more years, but eight, to come knocking again.

And now, as Peter Drury put it, “The greatest player of his age finally has the greatest accolade football can afford him.”

It will be a long time before any other player should come around and make us feel the same way we do about Lionel Messi — that is if we should ever feel that way again in our time. But even if we don’t, after witnessing “one of the greatest football matches ever played,” it hardly feels like we need to.
