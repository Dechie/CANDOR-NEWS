<h2>Ethiopia's Tigray forces say they hand over heavy weapons</h2>

<img src="getachewReda.jpg" width="400" height="300">

<p>The spokesman for Tigray forces in Ethiopia says they have handed over heavy weapons as a key part of the agreement signed with Ethiopia’s government late last year to end a two-year conflict.</p>

<p>Getachew Reda tweeted early Wednesday that an African Union monitoring team confirmed the handover. He expressed hope it would “go a long way in expediting the full implementation of the agreement.”</p>

<p>The Tigray forces especially seek the withdrawal of troops from neighboring Eritrea, which has fought alongside Ethiopian forces but was not a party to the agreement. Witnesses have told The Associated Press that Eritrean fighters remain in some communities.</p>

<p>The United States and United Nations, citing the work of academics, have estimated that hundreds of thousands of people died in the conflict in Africa’s second most populous country.</p>

<p>Basic services, flights and humanitarian aid have begun to resume to the long cut-off Tigray region of more than 5 million people.</p>
