  <h2>  Erik ten hag named luis van gaal among his football inspirations <br>  </h2>
  Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has declared both Louis van Gaal and Johan Cruyff as two of his greatest footballing inspirations.

  The United manager began his coaching journey back in 2008 alongside former England boss Steve McClaren, entering the dugout to become his assistant.
  
  Since then Ten Hag has enjoyed a superb rise to the top, whilst his time at Ajax stands out as a particularly proud phase of his life. Now, enjoying success at Old Trafford thus far, the Dutchman has revealed his fondness for his fellow countrymen.
  "Previously, he [Kees Rijvers] was a very good player and I also had the luck, for two years, that he was my coach at FC Twente and I learnt a lot about him, about organisation in football, about his philosophy, about playing from the back, attacking football and about team spirit,'' the 52-year-old told ManUtd.com.

''But also other managers inspired me, definitely, like Louis van Gaal, Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff, they are the big inspirers.''
