                <p>After 13 years of prolonged wait, the next chapter of the epic saga, “Avatar: The Way of Water,” has finally been released in theaters worldwide. The sequel has successfully created the identical charm of magic realism all over again, all the while opening the gateway to a new frontier of life in Pandora.</p>

              <font face="Arial" color="white">
                <p>The second installment picks up the pieces of the past and focuses on the familial relationships among key characters. At the same time, the movie bedazzled viewers with all its immersive underwater scenery to the point that the line between fiction and reality blurs big time. Cameron, the self-proclaimed “King of the World,” has once again managed to create a cinematic experience that is timeless, universal, and full of heart—a worthy successor to the director’s magnum opus.
