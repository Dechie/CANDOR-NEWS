   <h2> Xavi: If Barcelona win no titles this season, the press are going to kill me </h2>

   Xavi Hernandez has made no secret of his excitement at having the chance of winning the Supercopa de Espana with Barcelona and the boost in morale and confidence it would give the team.

Despite this, he is wary of Real Betis and warned that they are a team that enjoy playing with the ball and are one of the best in Spain.

"They are an opponent who play very well with the ball. The coach is very attacking. All the players in the squad play for him. They are a very strong opponent technically, they have a very powerful double pivot," Xavi said.

"They are very complete. We will have our work cut out because they are difficult. They suffer without the ball. I think that will be the key tomorrow.

The Supercopa presents Xavi with a chance to taste success as Barcelona boss for the first time, and he wants to get his hands on the trophy.

"It's a title we haven't won yet. We are doing well. We will try to show our personality," Xavi declared.

"It wouldn't change too much to win the title, but we're motivated to do it because it would be the first of the season and it would give us peace of mind.

"I'm really looking forward to it. I have the illusion and the desire. I'm here to win titles and if there are no titles this season, you're going to kill me. We haven't won any titles for a while and it's about time we did."

Sergio Busquets' future is likely to lie away from Barcelona, and the coach discussed his former teammate's importance.

"For me he is an influential player in the team. He is the captain. He is vital in the dressing room and is an example. The team always comes first for him and that's priceless. When he's not on the pitch, it shows. I think there's a before and after in that position since his arrival. He is a model," Xavi added.

On Saudi Arabia as host country, the boss was also pressed for his thoughts.
