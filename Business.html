            <p>US energy giant ExxonMobil is suing the European Union (EU) in a bid to stop its new windfall tax on oil
              firms.</p>
          </font>
          <font face="Arial">
            <p>A windfall tax is imposed on firms that benefited from something they were not responsible for.
              Energy firms are getting much more money for their oil and gas, partly due to supply concerns after
              Russia's
              invasion of Ukraine.</p>
          </font>
          <font face="Arial">
            <p>But Exxon has accused Brussels of exceeding its legal authority, calling the measure
              "counter-productive".
              ExxonMobil reported a quarterly profit of almost $20 billion (£17.3 billion) in October.
              The company, along with other major players in the oil and gas sector, has argued that a crackdown,
              however,
              would discourage investment.

            <p>In September, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen announced an emergency plan for major oil,
              gas
              and coal companies to pay a "crisis contribution" on their increased 2022 profits.

            <p>A 33% tax on this year's profits was announced - those profits were more than 20% higher than the average
